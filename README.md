# svd
CMSIS-SVD files, for convenience. All of these files are provided by
MCU/CPU vendors, although some of them have been corrected, in case of
obvious mistakes in the original files, whose solution was obvious too.

The reason why this repository exists at all is that there is no
official public repository that contains these files.

# License
The license that applies to files in this repository is the original
vendor license, which typically is unclear. Some README files are
provided, with links to the original source for the files. Users of this
repository are responsible for checking that they do not breach any
license when using the files.
